### Types

Types define which kind of changes you made to the project.

| Types    | Description                                                                                                  |

| perf     | A code change that improves performance.                                                                     |

### Scopes

Scopes define what part of the code changed.

### Examples

```sh
git commit -m "feat(users): add POST /users/signup"
git commit -m "docs(readme): update installation process"
git commit -m "fix(messages): should emit events to connected users"
```

## Directory Structure

Services are listed in the `src/services` directory.

### Example

We have API REST services for the `channels`.

Here is what potentially look like a folder structure for this service :

```text
â””â”€â”€ channels
    â”œâ”€â”€ __docs__
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ get.yaml
    â”œâ”€â”€ __test__
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ get.test.ts
    â”œâ”€â”€ :channelId
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __docs__
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ delete.yaml
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ put.yaml
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __test__
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ delete.test.ts
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ put.test.ts
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ delete.ts
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ put.ts
    â”œâ”€â”€ get.ts
    â””â”€â”€ index.ts
```

This folder structure will map to these REST API routes :

- GET `/channels`
- DELETE `/channels/:channelId`
- PUT `/channels/:channelId`

The folders after `src/services` : is the real name of the routes in the API except folders starting and ending with `__` like `__docs__`, `__test__` or `__utils__`.

The filenames correspond the HTTP method used (`get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`).
